                <p>Hi there and welcome to my virgin post. Please be&nbsp;gentle, we don't want to have bad memories&nbsp;this time.</p>
<p>I'm a Berlin based 20-something guy that is into computer science. I speak quite a few programming languages and focus on building stable, fault-tolerant, and distributed systems. I'm also having interests in different areas of machine learning&nbsp;especially deep learing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides technology I like things like photography, hiking,&nbsp;volleyball and lots of outdoorsy activities. You may see posts that include these kind of things as well in the future.</p>
<p>Have a good one for now.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>Chris</p>
